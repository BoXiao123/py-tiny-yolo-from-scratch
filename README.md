py-tiny-yolo-from-scratch
====
this repository is implementing tiny yolo by python from scratch. Yolo is a great and light weight deep learning platform. 
		https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/

If you want to understand the full details of convolutional neural networks, you need to learn how to implement it from scatch. This code is based on the original codes of YOLO. And it is a python implementation. To sum up, it is a python vision of forward propogation of tiny yolo.

Requirments
---
Numpy Opencv3

Usage
---
python main.py

Main parts
---
	main.py 
	This is the pipeline of the tiny yolo. I have embeded the .cfg into the main.py.
	You can easily see the tiny yolo structure in this script.
